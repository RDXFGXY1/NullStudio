# Bot Features

Here's a rundown of the cool things I can do to enhance your server's music experience:

*   **YouTube Music Playback:** I can play almost any song or audio directly from YouTube. Just give me a link or tell me what to search for!

*   **Server Music Queue:** Add multiple songs to a shared queue for your server. I'll play them one after another.

*   **Standard Playback Controls:** You get all the usual controls:
    *   Start playing (`/play`)
    *   Pause the music (`/pause`)
    *   Resume paused music (`/resume`)
    *   Skip to the next song (`/skip`)
    *   Stop the music entirely and clear the queue (`/stop`)
    *   Adjust the volume (`/volume`)

*   **See What's Playing:** Use `/nowplaying` to get details about the song currently playing.

*   **Check the Queue:** Use `/queue` to see the list of songs coming up next.

*   **Looping Options:** Don't want the music to end? You can loop!
    *   Loop the single song that's currently playing (`/loop mode:Loop Current Song`).
    *   Loop the entire queue, so it starts again from the beginning when it finishes (`/loop mode:Loop Entire Queue`).
    *   Turn looping off (`/loop mode:Off`).

*   **Shuffle the Queue:** Mix things up! Use `/shuffle` to randomize the order of songs currently waiting in the queue.

*   **Lyrics:** Curious about the words? Use `/lyrics` while a song is playing, and I'll try my best to find and display the lyrics for you. (Note: This feature depends on the bot owner setting up specific API keys, so it might be disabled.)

*   **Personal Playlists:** Save and manage your own collections of songs!
    *   Create new playlists (`/playlist create`).
    *   Add songs to your playlists (`/playlist add`).
    *   View the songs in a playlist (`/playlist show`).
    *   Remove songs from a playlist (`/playlist remove`).
    *   Delete playlists you no longer need (`/playlist delete`).
    *   List all your playlists (`/playlist list`).
    *   Load a playlist directly into the server queue (`/playlist load`).
    *   Save the current server queue as a new playlist (`/playlist savequeue`).
    *   Make your playlists public for others to see and load, or keep them private (`/playlist privacy`).

*   **Playlist Limits & Premium:** By default, you can create up to 2 private playlists. If your server owner has set up a premium role (often linked to Patreon or similar support), having that role might grant you unlimited playlists!

*   **Auto-Disconnect:** To keep things tidy, if I'm left alone in a voice channel, not playing anything, and the queue is empty, I'll automatically leave after 10 minutes. I'll let you know before I go!

Use `/` to see all my commands and start listening!
