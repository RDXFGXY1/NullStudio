# Null-Music

## Introduction

Null-Music is a lightweight yet powerful Discord music bot designed to deliver high-quality playback with an intuitive interface. Built with a focus on usability, responsiveness, and feature completeness, it empowers users to control music in real-time with minimal effort.

## Philosophy

This bot is built on three principles:

1. **Simplicity** — Easy to use, even for first-time users.
2. **Stability** — Reliable playback with minimal latency.
3. **Efficiency** — Lightweight performance that scales with your community.

## Key Features

- **YouTube Streaming**  
  Play any public YouTube audio or video using either search terms or direct links.

- **Full Queue Control**  
  Add, skip, pause, shuffle, or loop tracks in a dynamic queue system.

- **Playlist Management**  
  Create personal playlists, add or remove songs, and load them into the server queue.

- **Lyrics Support**  
  Automatically retrieve lyrics for the currently playing track (when available).

- **Slash Commands**  
  Uses Discord's built-in slash commands for seamless access to all features.

- **Auto-Disconnect**  
  Leaves empty voice channels automatically to save resources.

## Getting Started

Invite the bot to your server and type `/play` followed by the song name or URL. The bot will join your voice channel and start playing immediately.

You can use `/queue`, `/pause`, `/resume`, and more to manage your session.  
See the full command list for details.

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
