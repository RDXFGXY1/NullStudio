# NullStudio

Welcome to the **NullStudio** official repository — the central hub for all of our Discord bot projects, announcements, and community updates.

This repository contains the source code, documentation, and resources for our two main bots:

- **Null-AI:** An intelligent AI-powered assistant for Discord servers. Supports real-time, contextual responses via `-ai [your query]`, creates temporary topic-based channels that auto-clean after 10 minutes of inactivity, and provides focused, organized discussions with easy server integration.

* **Null Tracker:** A powerful monitoring bot designed to keep track of server activities, including member joins, message logs, moderation actions, and more — helping admins maintain a healthy and secure server environment.

* **NullFrequance:** A music bot focused on delivering high-quality audio streaming and interactive commands to enhance your server’s entertainment experience.

Here, you will find everything you need to get started, contribute, or simply stay informed about the latest features and improvements. Whether you are a developer interested in collaborating or a server owner looking to deploy these bots, this repo is your go-to resource.
