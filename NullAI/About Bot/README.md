## What Makes Null-AI Unique?

- **Intelligent AI Assistant:**  
  Null-AI provides real-time, context-aware responses to user queries, making interactions on your server more meaningful and efficient.

- **Temporary Topic Channels:**  
  When a user asks a question with the `-ai` command, Null-AI automatically generates a dedicated temporary channel for that topic. This allows focused discussion without cluttering your server.

- **Auto-Cleanup:**  
  Temporary channels self-destruct after 10 minutes of inactivity, helping keep your server organized and free of unused channels. A warning message is issued after 5 minutes of activity.

- **User-Friendly Commands:**  
  Interact with Null-AI using simple commands like `-ai [your question]`. No complicated setup or learning curve required.

- **Easy Integration:**  
  Null-AI can be invited to any Discord server with a simple authorization link.
