# New Feature Added: Channel Log Reset Command!


## What’s New?
- **`/reset_channel` Command:**  
  Server admins can now use this command to reset log assignments for any text channel.
- If the channel is set for more than one type of log, you’ll get a menu to pick which one to reset.
- Only admins with “Manage Channels” permission can use this command.

## Why is this useful?
- Quickly update or clean up your log settings.
- Prevents confusion by letting you choose exactly which log to reset in each channel.
- Helps keep your server organized!

## How to Use?
Just type `/reset_channel` in any text channel where you want to reset log setups.  
The bot will guide you through the rest!
